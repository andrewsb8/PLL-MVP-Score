# PLL-MVP-Score
Data for PLL MVP determined by scoring system inspired by Athlete's Unlimited

Is the MVP race in the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL), or any sport, too subjective? What could we do to quantify the MVP race and make the decision more systematically? Athlete's Unlimited has attempted to implement a solution to such a question in their professional women's lacrosse league. It's natural to ask how this would apply to other leagues, like the PLL.

This repository contains an excel sheet (in Microsoft Office and LibreOffice formats) which show PLL player data for each year. Additional columns have been added to calculate Player Points accrued according to the Champion scoring system used by [Athlete's Unlimited (AU) professional women's lacrosse league](https://auprosports.com/lacrosse/how-we-play/). Only points from individual statistics are considered. The AU scoring system was then modified to better fit the PLL rule set while maintaining position parity for MVP consideration. 

You can sort the tables by any column. Particularly, you can sort by the last two columns to see who would be awarded MVP in each scoring system in each year. There is also a sheet which a user can change the scoring system and see how it affects the standings in each year. You can download these tables and play with it yourself and see how changes you would make to the score would affect the outcome.
